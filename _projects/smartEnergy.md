Smart Energy is a public service campaign to de-stigmatize nuclear energy. An overwhelming amount of reliable, peer-reviewed science shows that nuclear is a safe, clean, reliable energy source, but much of the public doesn't know or doesn't believe it.

This campaign focused on delivering the hard facts and data to normal people in an approachable, easily digestible way. Scores of spreadsheets and charts may show hard, undeniable evidence in support of X cause, but it's useless if the target audience doesn't actually pay attention to it. To solve this problem, this campaign uses bright, eye-catching graphics with equally attention-grabbing facts to inform people of complex topics.

I designed a campaign book for this project, in addition to a brand/campaign identity, logo, wall graphics, and posters.

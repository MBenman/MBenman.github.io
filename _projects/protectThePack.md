This project is a series of signs that I designed in order to engage the Northeastern University community with reminders on how to stay safe while socializing with friends on campus during the age of COVID-19. As a designer in the University Sign Shop, the External Affairs department commissioned me to design these signs for their provided copy.

The goal of the project was to design fun, striking, vibrant signs that fit the theme of the existing #ProtectThePackNU COVID-19 safety marketing campaign. This campaign makes use of plenty of bright, painterly elements that add a hand-made quality to all of the materials.

I collaborated with the External Affairs' design team to iterate and refine these designs, while respecting the campaign and University brand guidelines.

In order to create signs that professionally represented the campus of 27,000+ students, I designed along with the guidelines of two brand books: one for the University at large, and one for Athletics Department-specific material.

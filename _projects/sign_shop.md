At the Northeastern Sign Shop, I created and produced a variety of signs to satisfy the needs of a broad, diverse client base across campus. Between directional signage, signs to support the COVID-19 Testing Center operations, social-distancing PSAs, and informational signage, I was able to collaborate with a small team to fulfill the wide-ranging needs of numerous campus departments.

In order to create signs that professionally represented the campus of 27,000+ students, I designed along with the guidelines of two brand books: one for the University at large, and one for Athletics Department-specific material.

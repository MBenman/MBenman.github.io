At the Northeastern Sign Shop, I designed and produced a variety of signs to satisfy the diverse needs of the campus’ broad client base. The Sign Shop team and I developed—from concept to delivery—directional signage, signs to support the COVID-19 Testing Center operations, social-distancing PSAs, and informational signage. The COVID-19 signage, specifically, contributed to the University’s success in seeing its 27,000+ students through a full school year even in the midst of a global pandemic.

To create consistent and professional signs throughout campus, I catered to the guidelines provided in two brand books—one for the University at large and another for Athletics Department-specific material. I then tailored solutions within these guidelines to the specific functional and stylistic requirements of individual departments.

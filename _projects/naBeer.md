NA Beer (working title) is a web project I'm building that helps people find non-alcoholic beer that they'll love. The craft non-alcoholic beer market has seen explosive growth in the past few years, yet there's still a dearth of review sites that explore the beverage and help people navigate the ever-growing options on the shelf. This is particularly frustrating for the many people that may be switching to drinking craft non-alcoholic beers from the "regular" craft beer space for the first time (either as a partial or full replacement), and may be unfamiliar with most of the brands.

Currently in the wireframe/strategy stage, this site helps users find their favorite non-alcoholic beer through an archive of detailed, easily-searchable reviews, in addition to articles about the industry, brewers, and other broader topics. I designed the search function so the user can find beers based on criteria like style and flavors, or by finding non-alcoholic beers that are similar to specific alcoholic beers that they already enjoy.

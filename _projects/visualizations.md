I designed these three projects to clearly visualize different separate datasets important to my life, in the format of three large (6' to 8') posters (Which unfortunately don't render as well on a screen). 

The first is a visualization of all of how much and what kind of coffee I drank for a month, comparing it to my daily heart rate range and sleep schedule. In the middle is a map showing the origins of all of the various coffees I drank in a month.

The second project is a timeline showing the highlights of the history of the development and production of coffee, distilling the long and winding history into digestible highlights. A map is tied to it to add geographic context for the major events, as well as to show the geographic spread of coffee across the planet over the centuries. 

The third is a set of three maps, visualizing some of my regularly-traveled routes throughout Boston. It includes details such as travel times for alternate routes, dangerous intersections that I encounter on each route, notable landmarks, and a generalized map of the surrounding area for context.

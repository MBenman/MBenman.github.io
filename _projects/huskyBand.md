Husky Band is a User Experience exploration focused on improving the unnecessarily complicated process of accessing on-campus apartments at Northeastern University. The (pre-COVID) process involved removing and tapping one's Husky Card (student ID card) up to four times in order to reach oneâ€™s bedroom, with PIN entry twice required, as well as a handoff to the proctor for picture identification. COVID protocols forced the University to remove this last requirement, but the entire process still remains time-consuming and awkward, especially when one is carrying in groceries, large packages, etc.

The Band itself is a waterproof silicone wristband with short-range RFID technology that allows it to be scanned in vestibules while the user walks in, and at door handles that the user turns. Visual/picture identification can be accomplished through the computer screen that building proctors already have at their station.

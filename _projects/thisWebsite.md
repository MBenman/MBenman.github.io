Like what you see? You are currently reading off of a website that I designed and built. It began life on Django with a Postgres database, all pushed to Heroku. In order to increase efficiency, I then transferred the template and content to a Jekyll site hosted through GitHub Pages. 

On the front end, I was going for a straightforward layout that let the content shine, with a few sparks of fun here and there. Simple animations are handled by HTML5, and more complex tweening (parallax, scroll-triggered animations) is run through GSAP.

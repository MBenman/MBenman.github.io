Like what you see? I designed and built this very website from scratch on Django, with a Postgres database and no frills to slow things down. On the front end, I was going for a straightforward layout that let the content shine, with a few sparks of fun here and there. Simple animations are handled by HTML5, and more complex tweening (parallax, scroll-triggered animations) is run through GSAP.

Better Weather is the working title for a web app that helps users find locations that have their favorite climate conditions. Weather and climate are personal preferences that vary widely. Some people love a healthy snowfall every year, while others don't enjoy a temperature dip below 70F.

When it's completed, this app will allow users to select their ideal climate conditions, showing them which locations in the US have corresponding climates (or as close as possible). It's effectively the reverse of normal weather apps - rather than inputting your location and receiving weather, you input the weather you'd like to see on a daily basis, and you receive a map of locations that have that weather. This allows people to easily find places that they might want to visit or live, based on the climate.

The data collection (mostly from the National Weather Service), processing (through python/pandas), and the back-end development (django/python) are all completed. I am currently working on the front-end design, UI, data visualizations, and brand design. In addition, once I have the basic functionality live, I will continue to update with new features, such as expanding the geographic scope globally, adding in demographic data for different locations, and a comparison tool that allows the user to settle the debate of which two locations have better or worse weather, based on a set of selected criteria.

Hi, I'm Maxwell. I like to team up with people to create nifty things that make people smile. I achieve that by blending technologies, hopping between design and development, and making sure everything has just the right spark for the task. I pride myself on having a broad, versatile skill set, and I'm as happy wielding a mouse and keyboard as I am a drill or soldering iron.

I'm looking to join a fast-paced, mission-driven team that values great work in all aspects-one that values innovative products, but also healthy team dynamics, efficient collaboration, and constructive communication.

If you have a team in the Greater Boston Area or online, with space for a dynamic, effective designer that can also make you a mean cocktail and play guitar just a bit too loud, then tap [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-benman/) to get in touch!

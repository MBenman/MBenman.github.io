Hi, I'm Maxwell. I love to team up with people to create nifty things that make people smile. I achieve that by blending technologies, hopping between design and development, and making sure everything has just the right spark for the task. I'm just as happy wielding the pen tool as I am a soldering iron or a pivot table, and I'm always looking for new tools to learn.

I'm looking to join a fast-paced, mission-driven team that values great work in all aspectsâ€”one that values innovative products, but also healthy team dynamics, efficient collaboration, and constructive communication.

If you have a team in the Greater Boston Area or online, with space for a dynamic, effective designer that can also make you a mean cocktail and play guitar just a bit too loud, then tap <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-benman/" class="highlight">here</a> to get in touch!
